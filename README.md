# HeapStudents_


### What we know

there should be an address.h, date.h, main.cpp, and student.h


## Address.h

this should store a few pieces of data
Street, City, State, and zip code
we can use init to initalize the address and printaddress to print the given address


## Date.h

it will store the date in classic format day, month, year as a string of course

init to initalize the date of course, and printdate to print the date when called in main

## Student.h

basic student information storing

--[[

    Should store the following
    ->
        first name : string
        last name : string
        address (from using the initalized address header) 
        birthdate(should use date.h)
        Credits : number
]]


# Main.cpp

given to me but compiles all of the headers in one
